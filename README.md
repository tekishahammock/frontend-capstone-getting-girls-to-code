# Front-end Capstone: Getting Girls to Code

### Game Background
This product, made as a significant project during my time as a Nashville Software School student, is a game made to get middleschool-aged girls interesting in web development. Development features of this game include use of Angular and Sass to achieve an easily understood, architecturally sound code base on which the game can be modified or expanded.

The final product is particularly close to my heart, in that it allows me to do my part in getting more girls and women interested in coding, as well as helping young girls understand that they have a place in STEM fields. Too often young girls are made to feel as if they shouldn't pursue technology and engineering fields for various reasons related to systematic sexism and casual misogyny, and more often than not it is allowed to be perpetuated by the lack of pro-active measures to combat the root of the problem. Even when women find later in life that they might be interested in joining the career field, they are usually at a disadvantage due to not having been exposed to cetain technological concepts in their youth.

This game is the beginning of an effort to make technology more accessible and desirable to young girls. Just as we expose our daughters to dance classes and art and our sons to Legos and Space Camp, we must be willing to provide all of our children with every opportunity to discover what it is that sparks their interest and lights them up.

### Game Code and Use Details
*Getting Girls to Code* was made using the Angular framework, Sass for CSS compilation, and Firebase as the game's back-end component. It specifically takes advantage of ES6 syntax and uses CSS transitions and animations in lieu of more traditional Javascript animations. The code here is provided for personal, non-commercial use.
